Step 1: Download Dataset 1 — Lettuce NPK Dataset

            Download the Lettuce NPK dataset from the following link:  
            https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/baronn/lettuce-npk-dataset  

Step 2: Download Dataset 2 — Soilless farming Dataset  

            Download the Soilless farming dataset from the following link:  
            https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10093804

Step 3: Open the Python Application  

            Navigate to the project folder named:  
            final_code  

Step 4: Open the Main Script  
 
            Open the file named:  
            code.py  

Step 5: Load the Dataset  

            When prompted:  
            - Enter the full path to the full dataset folder.

            - Your dataset folder should look like this:
              dataset/
               class_1/
                image1.jpg
                image2.jpg
               class_2/
                image3.jpg
                image4.jpg

Step 6: Run the Application  

            Execute the script to train and evaluate the model using the provided dataset.

Step 7: View the Output  

            - The model will display performance metrics, including:
               Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Specificity, Misdetection Rate, Confidence Score, Growth Index, and Negative Predictive Value. 
                                                                                                                              
            - The trained model will also be saved automatically.

Step 8: Repeat for All Datasets  

             Repeat Steps 3 to 7 for each of the 2 datasets to complete the full evaluation.
